I need help setting up Kubernetes for my e-commerce application.

I have three parts:
- A web frontend that users see
- A backend API that handles business logic
- A PostgreSQL database

I want to:
- Put everything in a namespace called "ecommerce"
- Make sure the frontend can be accessed from the internet
- Have the frontend talk to the backend
- Have the backend talk to the database
- Store database connection info safely
- Scale the frontend when it gets busy

Can you create the Kubernetes files for me?
